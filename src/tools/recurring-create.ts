/**
 * q402_recurring_create - author a new recurring-payment rule on the
 * Agent Wallet.
 *
 * Mode-C-only (apiKey auth). Single-recipient - for multi-recipient
 * payroll rules the user opens the dashboard. The recurring scheduler
 * itself handles cancel-window alerts and the hourly heartbeat that
 * drives every cadence. Each fire is gated server-side by BOTH the
 * wallet's `perTxMaxUsd` (per-fire cap) AND its `dailyLimitUsd`: the
 * rule's daily total reserves against the same daily bucket as manual
 * sends (a 2026-06-10 fix - the cron skips the fire if the bucket can't
 * cover it), so scheduled rules can't outrun the dashboard caps. This
 * tool additionally applies the client-side Q402_MAX_AMOUNT_PER_CALL +
 * Q402_ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS rails to (recipient, amount) at author time,
 * matching the one-shot q402_pay / q402_batch_pay guards.
 *
 * Frequency strings (validated server-side):
 *   "hourly:N"      N=1..23. Fires every N hours, snapped to the next
 *                    :00 UTC after the cancel window.
 *   "daily"         once per day at the creation-minute UTC.
 *   "weekly:{day}"  day in {mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat,sun}.
 *   "monthly:N"     day-of-month 1..31 (fires last day if shorter).
 *   "monthly:last"  last day of every month.
 *
 * Recurring is a paid feature on EVERY chain, including BNB. Trial keys
 * are rejected at create time with `MULTICHAIN_REQUIRED` even when the
 * user picks `chain: "bnb"` - trial keys can still pay manually via
 * `q402_pay`, but scheduled fires consume paid-tier quota and require
 * the live Multichain subscription.
 *
 * Hits POST /api/wallet/agentic/recurring-by-key { action: "create", ... }.
