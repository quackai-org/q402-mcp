/**
 * q402_yield_positions - read-only Q402 Yield lending-position snapshot.
 *
 * Returns the Agent Wallet's current lending positions: per-market the
 * CURRENT supplied position value (the live aToken balance, which already
 * includes accrued interest but is NOT broken out into principal vs.
 * earnings) and the live supply APY, plus an aggregate current value in
 * USD. No state change, no funds move.
 *
 * NOTE: this Phase-0 read does NOT report principal or accrued earnings as
 * separate figures - the server returns those as null (it tracks no
 * deposit-time principal yet), so we surface only what's real: the current
 * position value + APY. Do not present a "you've earned $X" number from this
 * tool; it isn't available.
 *
 * Authenticated by the live Multichain API key, sent in the `x-api-key`
 * header (the same resolved key the Mode C pay path uses). The walletId
 * is optional - when omitted, the landing route resolves the owner's
 * default Agent Wallet from the apiKey, so we only pass walletId when the
 * caller explicitly provides one (or Q402_AGENT_WALLET_ADDRESS is set).
