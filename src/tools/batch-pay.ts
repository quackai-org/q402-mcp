/**
 * q402_batch_pay - fan out a single chain × token settlement to up to
 *   - 5 recipients per call on trial-tier keys
 *   - 20 recipients per call on paid keys
 *
 * Same authorisation primitives as q402_pay: one EIP-712 witness +
 * one EIP-7702 authorization per recipient, all signed locally by
 * `Q402_PRIVATE_KEY` before the batch is shipped to the server. The
 * sender pays $0 in gas regardless of batch size - Q402's relayer
 * covers gas for every transfer.
 *
 * Sandbox-default, same gating as q402_pay. Live mode requires the
 * resolved scope key (Q402_TRIAL_API_KEY / Q402_MULTICHAIN_API_KEY /
 * legacy Q402_API_KEY fallback) to be q402_live_* AND Q402_PRIVATE_KEY
 * set AND Q402_ENABLE_REAL_PAYMENTS=1.
 *
 * Auto-routing follows the SAME rule as q402_pay: chain="bnb" +
 * Q402_TRIAL_API_KEY set → Trial; else Multichain. The one extra
 * twist is the ambiguity gate: when a 6+ recipient BNB batch arrives
 * with a Trial key set AND no explicit keyScope, this tool does NOT
 * execute - it returns status="ambiguous" with a setupHint listing
 * three choices (trial-first-5, multichain-all, or split via two
 * separate calls). The agent surfaces the choices to the human and
 * re-invokes with an explicit keyScope. This avoids the two silent
 * failure modes (paid-pool charged when user expected free; or 5-cap
 * server error masking user intent).
 *
 * The recipient allowlist runs per recipient - every row must clear it.
 * The amount cap runs both per recipient AND on the batch total, so a
 * large sum can't be fanned across many sub-cap rows to slip the limit.
 *
 * Server-side execution is sequential. The first recipient installs
 * the EIP-7702 delegation on the owner's EOA; remaining recipients
 * use that delegation. If recipient[0] fails the batch aborts; later
 * failures are surfaced in the result array without aborting.
