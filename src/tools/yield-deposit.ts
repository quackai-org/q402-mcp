/**
 * q402_yield_deposit - WRITE / MOVES FUNDS. Supplies the Agent Wallet's
 * stablecoin into Q402 Yield's curated lending market for the chosen chain
 * so it starts earning supply APY.
 *
 * Server-mediated (Mode C): authenticated by the live Multichain API key
 * sent in the JSON BODY, matching how the agentic pay/send path
 * authenticates. The server holds the Agent Wallet's encrypted key, signs
 * the lending-market `supply`, and auto-funds source-chain gas - the MCP
 * never holds a private key for this path.
 *
 * SAFETY GATE - mirrors q402_pay: this tool MOVES FUNDS, so it refuses to
 * execute unless `confirm === true`. When `confirm` is missing/false the
 * tool does NOT call the endpoint; it returns (NOT an error) a one-line
 * description of exactly what will happen and asks the agent to re-call
 * with confirm:true after the user approves.
