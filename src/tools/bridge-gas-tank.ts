/**
 * q402_bridge_gas_tank - show LINK + native Gas Tank balance per CCIP chain.
 *
 * Lets the agent check whether the user has enough Gas Tank balance to fund
 * a bridge before committing. Returns LINK balance + native balance per of
 * the 3 CCIP chains (eth/avax/arbitrum). Surfaces deposit addresses for
 * top-ups.
 *
 * Current release: read-only guidance - full balance fetch requires
 * owner-sig auth which lands in a follow-up. Tool exists today so
 * doctor/agents can route users to the dashboard's Bridge Gas Tank
 * section.
