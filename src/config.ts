 *   Q402_TRIAL_API_KEY       BNB-only sponsored Trial key (free 2k TX).
 *   Q402_MULTICHAIN_API_KEY  Paid 12-chain key backed by per-chain Gas Tank.
 *   Q402_API_KEY             Legacy single-key fallback. Used for both

 * Sandbox-default by design - `q402_pay` only performs a real on-chain
 * transaction when *all three* conditions hold for the scope being used:
 *   1. The scope-resolved key is set and starts with `q402_live_`
 *   2. `Q402_ENABLE_REAL_PAYMENTS=1`
 *   3. `Q402_PRIVATE_KEY` is set
 *
 * Any other state falls back to sandbox: a deterministic-looking fake txHash
 * is returned so an agent can complete its workflow, but no funds move and no
 * relay credit is consumed.

 *
 * Why we read this directly instead of asking the user to wire shell
 * sourcing through every MCP client:
 *   - The MCP server is spawned as a subprocess by Claude / Codex /
 *     Cursor / Cline. Subprocesses inherit env from their parent, not
 *     from arbitrary files on disk - so a `~/.q402/mcp.env` would be
 *     invisible without each client either inlining secrets in config
 *     or the user maintaining shell-source plumbing per client.
 *   - Reading the file here gives a single, client-agnostic install
 *     pattern: drop one file in your home dir, every MCP client just
 *     works. Same approach AWS CLI / Stripe CLI / gh CLI use.
 *   - The `q402_doctor` tool generates and seeds this file on first
 *     install via a `recommendedActions` payload the client executes
 *     with its own filesystem tool.
 *
 * Filter: only `Q402_*` keys are imported, so a stray `PATH=...` in
 * the file can't poison the MCP server's environment.

 *     ahead of this gate in `pay.ts` / `batch-pay.ts`.
 *
 * The PK format check matters: the 0.5.6 doctor template shipped with
 * `Q402_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...` as a placeholder, and the previous version
 * of this function (which only checked truthiness) let the literal
 * string `"0x..."` through - q402_pay then threw inside `new Wallet()`
 * instead of dropping into a friendly sandbox response. Validating the
 * shape here means a placeholder-tripped live mode now resolves to
 * sandbox + a clear setupHint.
 *
 * Earlier revisions hard-required `Q402_PRIVATE_KEY` regardless of
 * effective mode. That blocked Mode B users (no MetaMask key, just the
 * exported Agent Wallet PK) from ever going live - making Mode B
 * useless as a prod option. The signer-selection step downstream picks
 * the correct PK based on the chosen `walletMode`, so the gate here
 * only needs to confirm that SOME valid signing key is available.
